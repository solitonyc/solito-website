		<h2>Meeting Bill Gates</h2>
			<p>In 1998, working as a Tech Specialist for the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm, a lucky opportunity came my way.</p> 
			<p>My manager assigned me to work with the legal team stationed in Washington DC. I was solely responsible for providing all around IT and network support for the legal team, who were now fully engaged with defending Bill Gates, and his company Microsoft against the United States of America in the famed “Antitrust Trial of the Century.”</p> 
				<p class="greenquote">It was an honor to meet Bill Gates himself and other Microsoft executives, such as Steve Ballmer, Jim Allchin, Paul Moritz & Bill Neukom.</p>	
			<p>Leading the team were highly regarded corporate attornies John Warden and Steve Holly, high-profile partners of the firm who were constantly appearing in newspapers and on TV in regards to the trial.</p>
			<p>I found great honor having the opportunity to meet Bill Gates himself and other Microsoft executives such as Steve Ballmer, Jim Allchin, Paul Moritz & Bill Neukom. I greatly appreciated this extraordinary experience considering Bill Gates, my hero, had inspired me to go back to school in order to get in the tech industry.</p>  
			<p>This fortuitous opportunity catapult me through my exciting tech future ahead.</p>
		<h2>Dot Com Days</h2>
			<p>I worked at my first tech startup in 1999, within New York's historical Silicon Alley district during the dot-com era with a company called US Interactive. Up to this point, I had worked really hard to learn all the skills needed to break into a tech company. I felt validated to finally earn a position at an innovative "dot com".</p>
				<p class="greenquote">After going public, the company exploded to over 15,000 employees worldwide. But it didn't last.</p>
			<p>There, I served as a desktop and network support engineer helping users across multiple offices. As an early hire, I experienced my office grow to over 200 employees. After going public in 1999, the company exploded to over 15,000 employees worldwide. But it didn't last. USI faced the same demise as other dot coms after the crash.</p>
		<h2>Installing Sattelite Systems Across America</h2>
			<p>I had already moved on before the crash, by taking on the role of Senior IT Executive at RAW Communications. I traveled frequently across the US, managing a team of satellite engineers implementing dishes and receivers on the rooftops of the biggest buildings for many of the most prestigious financial institutions in the world, including the original World Trade Center and Fidelity tower in Boston. Our clients were well known, such as Oppenheimer, Brandeis, AIM, State Street and Fidelity. RAW provided the means for traders, portfolio and wealth managers to view live, corporate officers presenting their company's quarterly financial reports directly on their screens (pre-broadband era). RAW was eventually bought out by ThomsonReuters.</p>
		<h2>Disrupting the Branding Business</h2>
			<p>From March 2002-2010, I served as Director of Information Technology and Managed Services at another tech startup called BrandWizard Technologies, a subsidiary of Omnicom Group, the world's largest holding company.</p> 
				<p class="greenquote">I undertook the build-out and growth of the managed services division (pre-virtual server era) which hosted the brand assets of numerous Fortune 500 companies, such as ExxonMobil, AT&T, Dell, GM, Barclays, TD Bank and HSBC.</p>
			<p>BrandWizard developed the first brand asset management SaaS. As an early hire, I undertook the build-out and growth of the managed services division (pre-cloud era) which hosted the brand assets of numerous Fortune 500 companies, such as ExxonMobil, AT&T, Dell, GM, Barclays, TD Bank, HSBC, Thomson Reuters and others. I ran this business within the business, which contributed to over 50% of the company’s revenue.</p>
		<h2>My First Startup Business</h2>
			<p>It was only matter of time that I start my own company. In 2010, I cofounded ReyesPearson International, an international recruiting agency focused on the healthcare industry.</p>
				<p class="greenquote">As a recruiter, I experienced first-hand all of the problems that traditional recruiters were facing and realized a software solution.</p>
			<p>I traveled to Asia looking for top doctors and nurses to place in the US. However, as a recruiter, I experienced first-hand all of the problems that traditional recruiters were facing and realized a software solution. This is how Cuzie came about.
			</p>
		<h2>Cofounding My First Tech Startup</h2>
			<p>I cofounded Cuzie Corp. in 2011 and served as CTO; conceived and authored its Patents, conceived and architected all of the applications.</p>
				<p class="greenquote">I was featured and interviewed by CIO Review magazine, which deemed Cuzie.com a “Top 40 HR Solution” for 2014.</p>
			<p>But, we were too early: Algorithmic Matching, Candidate Ranking Systems, Asymmetrical video quenstionaires and live Video Interviewing & Evaluations Systems were a daunting undertaking. Essentially, you could post a job, find candidates, interview them online and hire someone all in a single session.</p> 
			<p>I raised $3.5MM in Angel funding for it. A couple of years later, I was featured and interviewed by CIO Review magazine, which deemed Cuzie.com a “Top 40 HR Solution” for 2014: http://hrtech.cioreview.com/vendor/2014/Cuzie_Corp. Unfortunately, similar to the fate of almost every startup, we ran out of funding.</p>
		<h2>Building an Enterprise Startup: Simplenight</h2>
			<p>I was fortunate enough to meet a tech founder, whom hire me as Chief Technology Officer. At Simplenight, I managed a global team of designers, software & systems engineers and project managers.</p> 
				<p class="greenquote">It was my responsibility to build the founder's vision!</p>
			<p>It was my responsibility to build the founder's vision, a massive Global Experience Platform(GEP); a system designed to serve an online marketplace platform, heralded as the first web-based Global Distribution System for experiential and travel related products. I assembled a world-class, international team running at full speed on a 24-hour development cycle to maket his happen. In the end, we managed to host over 1 billion products. Unfortunaly, they took ran into financial difficulties too.</p>
		<h2>So What's Next?</h2>
			<p>It's time to retool. I'm exciting to learn about the latest and greatest in regards to software engineering, and get hands-on with coding. My OCD needs something new to focus on.
